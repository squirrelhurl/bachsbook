was established in September 1998, after several homeschooling families agreed that a choir would meet a specific need for local home school children. The group had an initial enrollment of 27, growing to 88 students four years later. The choir serves all interested home-educated students from ages 8 to 18.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The choir was originally called B-N Home School Choir and was organized under the direction of Don Lusk, a former high school music teacher, and his wife, Angela, who passed away in 2017. Both felt the call to lead this effort through the homeschooling community as a ministry. Mrs. Wendy Seiler was our first accompanist. In September 2000, Mrs. Patricia Cole became an accompanist and served the choir for 15 years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Staff</title><link>https://bachschoir.org/docs/staff/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 22:22:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://bachschoir.org/docs/staff/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>OUR STAFF&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BACHS choir&amp;rsquo;s mission is to offer students of home education families the opportunity to grow musically through quality music instruction withing the context of a developmental music program. The choir seeks to musically enrich its members using principles, techiques, mthods, and choral literature and will foster a lifelong appreciation of choral music through preparation and performances to glorify God and serve our community.&lt;/p>
